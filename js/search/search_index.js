scalable server-side applications, heavily inspired by Angular.\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nDescription\nPrerequisites\nDeployment\nEnvironment Configuration\nChoosing a Web Framework\nHTTP2\nChoosing a Database\nTesting\nTypeDocs\nLogs\n\n🔎 This repo was created with Nx.\n📚 Description\nThis boilerplate is made to quickly prototype backend applications. It comes with authentication/authorization, logging, crud features and database persistence out of the box.\n\n🛠️ Prerequisites\nNon Docker\n\nPlease make sure to have Node.js (16+) locally by downloading the Javascript runtime via brew, choco, or apt-get.\n\nPlease make sure to have MYSQL locally by deploying a web server stack like XAMPP. The control panel can then trigger MYSQL to start on localhost. MYSQL can be downloaded standalone via brew, choco, or apt-get.\n\n\nDocker 🐳\n\nPlease make sure to have Docker Desktop operational to quickly compose the required dependencies. Then follow the docker procedure outlined below.\n\n\n🚀 Deployment\nManual Deployment without Docker\n\nClone the repo via git clone https://github.com/msanvarov/nest-rest-typeorm-boilerplate.\n\nDownload dependencies via npm i or yarn.\n\nCreate a .env file via the cp .env.example .env command and replace the existing environment variable placeholders with valid responses.\n\nStart the api in development mode by using npm run start (the app will be exposed on http://localhost:3333; not to conflict with React, Angular, or Vue ports).\n\n\n\nOptional deployment of the UI\n\n\n\nThis repo comes with a UI built with Angular - that can be accessed via http://localhost:4200.\n\nTo start the UI, start a new terminal window and run npm run start --project ui.\n\n\n\nRemark: In the docker deployment, the UI is automatically started and served by the API.\n\n\n\n\nDeploying with Docker 🐳\n\nExecute the following command in-app directory:\n\n# creates and loads the docker container in detached mode with the required configuration\n$ docker-compose up -d\nThe following command will download dependencies and execute the web application on http://localhost:80 (deployed behind a Nginx reverse proxy).\n\n\n🔒 Environment Configuration\nBy default, the application comes with a config module that can read in every environment variable from the .env file.\nAPP_ENV - the application environment to execute as, either in development or production. Determines the type of logging options to utilize. Options: development or production.\nWEBTOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY - the key to encrypt/decrypt web tokens with. Make sure to generate a random alphanumeric string for this.\nWEBTOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME - the time in seconds when the web token will expire; by default, it's 2400 seconds which is 40 mins.\nDB_TYPE - the type of database connection to use.\nDB_USERNAME - username for authenticating against the database.\nDB_PASSWORD - password for authenticating against the database, can be left empty if a password is not needed (not safe).\nDB_HOST - the endpoint where this database sits (default is localhost but can be set explicitly).\nDB_PORT - default ports for different types of database connections.\nDB_DATABASE - the actual database name to perform operations on.\n\n🏗 Choosing a Web Framework\nThis boilerplate comes with Fastify out of the box as it offers performance benefits over Express. But the Express adapter is still accessible on a different branch.\n\n💾 Choosing a Database\nBy default MYSQL/MariaDB are the database of choice but TypeORM supports other database types like SQLite, Postgres, MongoDB, and MSSQL. To use anything other than MYSQL/MariaDB, change the configuration in the .env file, and download the corresponding wrapper library, like SQLite3.\n\nCheck https://typeorm.io/ for supported database types.\n\nRemark: For MongoDB, TypeORM is not as feature-rich as Mongoose. Therefore I created another boilerplate for Nest and Mongoose.\n\n🦾 HTTP/2\nLuckily, Fastify can enable HTTP2 over either HTTPS (h2) or plaintext (h2c) out of the box. This boilerplate makes use of this on the feat/http2 branch where a self-signed certificate was created for testing this capability. The certificate is located in the certs folder. For production, please use a valid certificate.\nThe self signed certificate can be generated via OpenSSL:\n$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout api-key.pem -out api-cert.pem -days 365 -nodes\n\nRemark: Express can be ran with HTTP/2 by employing the spdy library.\n\n\n✅ Testing\nDocker 🐳\n# Start the docker container if it's not running\n$ docker start nest-rest-typeorm-api\n\n# unit tests\n$ docker exec -it nest-rest-typeorm-api npm run test\nNon-Docker\n# execute test\n$ npm run test\n💡 TypeDocs\nThe documentation for this boilerplate can be found on Github pages.\nThe docs can be generated on-demand, by typing npm run typedocs:api:start. This will produce a docs/api folder with the required front-end files and start hosting on localhost.\n\nRemark: The docs for the ui are generated on-demand, by typing npm run typedocs:ui:start. This will produce a docs/ui folder with the required front-end files and start hosting on localhost.\n\n# generate docs for api code\n$ npm run typedocs:api:start\n📝 Open API\nOut of the box, the web app comes with Swagger; an open api specification, that is used to describe RESTful APIs. Nest provides a dedicated module to work with it.\nThe configuration for Swagger can be found at this location.\n\n✨ TypeORM\nTypeORM is an object-relational mapping that acts as an abstraction layer over operations on databases. Please view the documentation for further details.\nThe configuration for TypeORM can be found in the app module.\n\n🔊 Logs\nThis boilerplate comes with a Winston module for extensive logging, the configurations for Winston can be found in the app module.\n\n🏗️ Progress\n\n\n\nBranches\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nmain\n✅\n\n\nfeat/*\n🚧\n\n\n\n Remark: This template was employed to create a [Real World
