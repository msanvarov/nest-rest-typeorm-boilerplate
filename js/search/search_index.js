applications, heavily inspired by Angular.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x1F4DA; Description\nThis boilerplate is made to quickly prototype backend applications. It comes with authentication, logging, security, and database features out of the box.\n\n&#x1F6E0;️ Prerequisites\nNon Docker\n\nPlease make sure to have MYSQL locally by utilizing a web server stack XAMPP. The control panel can then trigger MYSQL to start on localhost.\n\nDocker &#x1F433;\n\nPlease make sure to have docker desktop on the operating system of choice to quickly compose both MariaDB and Nginx. Then follow the docker procedure outlined below.\n\nNote: Docker Desktop comes free on both Mac and Windows, but it only works with Windows 10 Pro. A workaround is to get Docker Toolbox which will bypass the Windows 10 Pro prerequisite by executing in a VM.\n\n&#x1F680; Setup\nManual Deployment without Docker\n\nCreate a .env file using the cp .env.example .env command and replace the existing environment variables with personal configuration settings (username and password database).\n\nDownload dependencies using npm i or yarn\n\nStart the app for pre-production using npm run start or npm run start:dev for development (the app will be exposed on the port 9000; safe port that doesn't conflict with React, Angular, or Vue)\n\n\nDeploying with Docker &#x1F433;\n\nExecute the following command in-app directory:\n\n# creates and loads the docker container in detached mode with the required configuration\n$ docker-compose up -d\nThe following command will set up and run the docker project for quick use (building both Dockerfile and Dockerfile-Nginx). Then the web application, Nginx, and MariaDB will be exposed to http://localhost:9000, http://localhost:80, and http://localhost:3306 respectively.\n\n&#x1F512; Environment Configuration\nBy default, the application comes with a config module that will inject the ConfigService to read every environment variable from the .env file.\nAPP_ENV - the application environment it will be executing as, either in development or production. Determines the type of logging options to utilize. Options: dev or prod. \nAPP_URL - the base URL for the application. Made mainly to showcase the ConfigService and can be removed if not used.\nWEBTOKEN_SECRET_KEY - the secret key to encrypt/decrypt web tokens with. Make sure to generate a random alphanumeric string for this. Not \nWEBTOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME - the time in seconds indicating when the web token will expire; by default, it's 2400 seconds which is 40 mins.\nDB_TYPE - the type of database connection to use.\nDB_USERNAME - username for authenticating against the database.\nDB_PASSWORD - password for authenticating against the database, can be left empty if a password is not needed (not recommended).\nDB_HOST - the endpoint where this database sits (usually localhost but can be a static address).\nDB_PORT - default ports for different types of database connections.\nDB_DATABASE - the actual database name to perform operations on.\n\n&#x1F3D7; Choosing a Web Framework\nThis boilerplate comes with Fastify out of the box as it offers performance benefits over Express. But this can be changed to use Express framework instead of Fastify. Please proceed the steps below to change between the two.\n\nReplace the following lines of code in the main.ts file with the ones detailed below.\n\n// from (fastify):\nimport {\n  FastifyAdapter,\n  NestFastifyApplication,\n} from '@nestjs/platform-fastify';\nimport * as headers from 'fastify-helmet';\nimport * as fastifyRateLimiter from 'fastify-rate-limit';\nconst app = await NestFactory.create(\n  AppModule,\n  new FastifyAdapter({ logger: console }),\n);\napp.register(headers);\napp.register(fastifyRateLimiter, {\n  max: 100,\n  timeWindow: '1 minute',\n});\n\n// to (express):\nimport * as headers from 'helmet';\nimport * as rateLimiter from 'express-rate-limit';\nconst app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, {\n  logger: console,\n});\napp.use(headers());\napp.use(\n  rateLimiter({\n    windowMs: 60, // 1 minutes\n    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs\n  }),\n);Note: The package.jsoncomes with dependencies for both Express and Fastify to support moving between two. But this can leave the project bloated especially when only one web framework is being used. Thus it is recommended that when deploying to production, a purger of unused dependencies occurs. \nIf you choose to use Fastify, this command will purge all of the Express dependencies:\n# removing Express dependencies\n$ npm rm @nestjs/platform-express express-rate-limit helmet swagger-ui-express @types/express --saveIf you choose to use Express, this command will purge all of the Fastify dependencies:\n# removing Fastify dependencies\n$ npm rm @nestjs/platform-fastify fastify-helmet fastify-rate-limit fastify-swagger --save\n&#x1F4BE; Choosing a Database\nBy default MYSQL/MariaDB are the database of choice but support for other database types like SQLite, Postgres, MongoDB, and MSSQL exist. To use anything other than MYSQL/MariaDB, change the configuration in the .env file, and download the corresponding wrapper library, like sqlite3 if necessary.\nNote: For MongoDB, TypeORM is not as feature-rich as Mongoose. Therefore I created another boilerplate for Nest and Mongoose.\n\n✅ Testing\nDocker &#x1F433;\n# unit tests\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:covNon-Docker\n# unit tests\n$ npm run test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ npm run test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ npm run test:cov\n&#x1F4A1; TypeDocs\nThe documentation for this boilerplate can be found on Github pages.\nThe docs can be generated on-demand, simply, by typing npm run typedocs. This will produce a docs folder with the required front-end files and start hosting on localhost port 8080.\n# generate docs for code\n$ npm run typedocs\n&#x1F4DD; Open API\nOut of the box, the web app comes with an open api specification, that is used to describe RESTful APIs. Nest provides a dedicated module to work with it.\nThe configuration for Swagger can be found at this location.\n\n✨ TypeORM\nTypeORM is an object-relational mapping that acts as an abstraction layer over operations on databases. Please view the documentation for further details.\nThe configuration for TypeORM can be found in the app module.\n\n&#x1F50A; Logs\nThis boilerplate comes with a Winston module for logging, the configurations for Winston can be found in the app module.\n\n&#x1F465; Support\nNest is an MIT-licensed open source project. It can grow thanks to the sponsors and support by the amazing backers.
